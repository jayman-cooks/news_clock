## June 30 - 3h
Finished the case! My onshape rendering was bugging a bit so the colors might look a bit funny. Here's the final image:

One thing you cant see is how I mounted the screen. I have it bolt in to a bracket that is fixed to the bottom case with a press-fit peg.

I wasn't really sure how to mount the buttons. I decided on just letting the button part of the buttons to slightly portrude, which requires a small cavity in the case for the rectangular part. The cavity will be filled with hot glue to fasten the buttons.

## June 25 - 3.5h
Worked on the case + did some research on components. I figured out I should use an rpi zero and a waveshare display(https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/lcd-oled/lcd-oled-3/1.9inch-lcd-module.htm). Here's a picture of my whole case so far:

I was trying to figure out how I would service the thing and work on it. I decided on making the bottom part removable, so I can slide it in and out. Here's the mechanism to do that:
