# Raspberry Pi News Alarm Clock
This my project for an alarm clock that reads you headlines from the New York Times every morning. I made it because I hadn't seen anything like it before, and I thought it would be cool to have the news read to me as I get ready in the morning. It is important to be informed about what is happening in the world, and now you can do it even when you are busy!

### Important Files
The case for the alarm clock is in new_case_top.stl and new_case_bottom.stl.

My wiring diagram is in circuit_diagram.png. The screen has a different size than the one used, but the pinout is the same. I don't have a pcb.

My code for running the alarm clock is in main.py and news.py. Main.py also has a simulator so you can run it on a normal computer as well. 


### BOM
My BOM is also in BOM.csv. I already have a bluetooth speaker to use. All shipping is free.
